    "This project leverages sentiment analysis of Reddit comments to predict potential Best Picture nominees. By collecting user comments from official discussion threads of various movies on the /r/movies subreddit, the program categorizes the sentiments expressed in the comments as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment scores are calculated for each movie based on the comments’ emotional tone, providing insights into how well-received the film is by the Reddit community.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment analysis is performed using TextBlob, and the results are visualized through bar charts and minimalist donut charts to showcase the distribution of sentiments and the overall sentiment score. The project’s goal is to analyze the public’s reaction to movies and hypothesize which films may have the most favorable reception, possibly correlating with future award nominations, such as the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis can be extended to include additional movies and threads, providing a dynamic and data-driven approach to movie discussions online."
